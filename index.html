Although hippies also gathered in many other places in the U.S., Canada and Europe, San Francisco was at that time the most publicized location for hippie fashions.</p>
      <p>Hippies, sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_child" target="_blank">flower children</a>, were an eclectic group. Many were suspicious of the government, rejected consumerist values, and generally opposed the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-vietnam-war/home/">Vietnam War</a>. A few were interested in politics; others were concerned more with art (music, painting, poetry in particular) or religious and meditative practices.</p>

      <h2>Generational Anthem</h2>
      <h3>San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)</h3>

It served to promote both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Pop_Festival" target="_blank">Monterey Pop Festival</a> that Phillips was helping to organize, and to popularize the flower children of San Francisco. Released on May 13, 1967, the song was an instant success. By the week ending July 1, 1967, it scored number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, where it remained for four consecutive weeks. Meanwhile, the song scored number one in the United Kingdom and much of Europe. The single is purported to have sold more than 7 million copies worldwide.</p>
